In 2015, University College Cork celebrates the bicentenary of George Boole, 1815-64. Boole, who
was born in Lincoln, was a mathematical genius who was largely self-taught. His appointment as the 
first Professor of Mathematics at this University in 1849 provided the opportunity to develop his 
most important work, An Investigation of the Laws of Thought.
